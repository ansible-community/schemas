# Warning: these schemas are generated

All the files from this folder are generated. Do not try to modify them by
hand if you want to fix a schema. Instead, edit the source files from src/
folder and run `tox` to recompile them.

You will need to include the generated file with your commit as this assures
we do not need to publish the results anywhere.
